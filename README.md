fidele007's Cydia repository for beta tweaks and stuff

**Hoho**. You're a nosy one, aren't you? You're not supposed to get here, actually, but since I don't want to spend money monthly just to keep the repo private. So yeah, I guess I get what I (don't) pay for.

Take a look. I won't bite. Just don't forget sad little old me if you get something out of this :)
