  "description": "<div>Breadcrumb10 has glitches here and there where the Wi-Fi icon overlaps with other status bar icons or sometimes just doesnâ€™t disappear even when the Wi-Fi is turned off. It's the little things that bug me so I make another one and name it BetterBreadcrumb10. If you don't notice any glitches using Breadcrumb10 or that they don't bother you, you don't need this.</div>",
